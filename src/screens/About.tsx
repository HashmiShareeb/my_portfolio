          Hey there! My name is
          <span className="font-semibold text-teal-500"> Shareeb Hashmi </span>I
          am a recent graduate from a college in Kortrijk, Belgium, where I
          spent two years studying programming. During my time in college, I
          gained valuable experience and knowledge in various programming
          languages and techniques. I also had the opportunity to complete an
          internship where I learned a lot and was able to apply my skills in a
          real-world setting. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in
          Next Web Development to further expand my skills and knowledge. I am
          excited to apply my skills and continue to learn and grow in the field
          of programming.
